# HealthJumpAPI

The purpose of this script is to pull down and filter patient demographics data from the HealthJump API sandbox. The parameters in this case are any patient with a first name of A, B, or C.

Running this script will:
1. Create a cache to pull from if same request is made within 5 minutes.
2. Call the HealthJump Authentication API to retrieve a Bearer Token.
3. Use the Bearer token and secret to call the HealthJump demographics api.
4. Pull back any patient records that have a first name of A, B, or C. 
5. Creates a Pandas dataframe from the response.
6. Convert the dataframe into a flat csv output. 

All functions should be reusable with other HealthJump API calls. You are able to change credentials, URL, and output filename without changing anything within the functions themselves.
